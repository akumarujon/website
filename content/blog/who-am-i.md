### Who am I?

My name is Akmal. "akumaru" is my nickname over the WWW. Many people know my original name and many of them don't. 
I am 17 years old developer form Uzbekistan. I've been learning coding since 2020(quarantine). I have tried a lot of languages so far like
PHP, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Rust, C++, Nim and V. I'm using some of them nowadays on my current projects. For example: Rust, Python and TypeScript. I've several projects that I mentioned on [projects page](https://akumarujon.uz/projects) but I have done lots of projects on my machine. I don't want to publish them because of sh*t code. I'm a real shitcoder. Actually almost all of my projects are built by shit code. But some of them are readable/better than the ones I haven't published.


### Past
I had lots of different nicknames before akumaru, like triistam, flynnson, git7i and more cringy ones. The reason why I change my nicknames so fast is I want to have a perfect nickname like my Idol has. But then I realised my old nicknames "akumaru"(I've used it since 2021) was good enough too. I left this one with me and killed my other personalities. I was trying to be the perfect coder, but I didn't feel it's happening. Many people left me then. I thought it was their faults until I realise I was the only one who is making mistakes so long. Yes alive people make mistakes, I realised it but it was too late. So I'm trying to be myself now.


### ...
My website might look so ugly. But it's my real website I've made since 2020. I've never been the developer who makes websites so easily. Front end development was always hard for me. I'm trying to learn and practice it in real projects. I'm developing my website actively: learning more about frontend, reading daily tutorials/articles, daily commiting. I hope it will look better than now in 1-2 months. Wish me good luck. I wish you good luck with your life.
